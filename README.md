# looper

I've been playing with loopers for a while, and none of them have all the functionality I need. I recently stumbled onto ChucK - which looks really promising.

This is a work in progress and I'm busy learning ChucK as I code this thing. A lot of this code is based on https://github.com/szymonkaliski/LoopPI2 .

I'm currently just plugging a Korg nano Kontrol into my mac for midi - will hopefully figure out how to put all the midi info  in a config file a little later. The plan is to eventually run this on a Raspberry Pi with an Arduino handling the midi. Also busy building a preamp etc. and will post all that info here as I go.
